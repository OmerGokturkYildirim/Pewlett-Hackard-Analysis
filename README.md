When we clean the data total employee is 300.000 and retiring employee is about 36.500
12% of the employees are going to retire very soon. 
Percentage of retiring employee is %17 for customer service, 16% for Research and 15% for Quality management. These three departments are going to be our first goal to start Mentorship program.
 Percentage of retiring employee is 13% and for human resources, 12% sales. Rest of the departmentsâ€™ percentages are 11% .
Although 11% of marketing department and %12 of sales department are less retiring employees, decreasing of employees in these departments, affect the income of the company, that is why these two departments are also need to be concerned.
86% percent of the customer service retiring employee is senior staff and staff
86% percent of the development retiring employee is engineer and senior engineer
86% percent of the production retiring employee is engineer and senior engineer. 
84% percent of the quality management retiring employee is engineer and senior engineer
81% percent of the retiring research employee is senior staff and staff
99% percent of the sales retiring employee is senior staff and staff. 
100% percent of the human resources retiring employee is senior staff and staff
100% percent of the finance retiring employee is senior staff and staff
100% percent of the marketing retiring employee is senior staff and staff.
When we look at all these data we can easily say almost 50% percent of the retiring employee is senior staff/engineer/leader. This should cause decreasing quality at all departments. Company should have extra budget for training current employees also human resources should work hard to find senior/leader employees.
